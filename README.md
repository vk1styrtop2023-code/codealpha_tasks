# **Code Alpha Machine Learning Internship Projects**
Welcome to my repository! In this repository, I will upload the source code of machine learning projects that I complete during my Code Alpha internship.


## **Projects Overview**

### **1. Credit Scoring Model**
This project focuses on developing a credit scoring model to evaluate the creditworthiness of applicants. It employs various machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of default based on historical data.

### **2. Emotion Recognition From Speech**
In this project, I implemented a model to recognize emotions from speech audio. The aim is to classify emotions using features extracted from the audio signals, facilitating applications in customer service and mental health.

### **3. Disease Prediction From Medical Data**
This project involves predicting diseases based on medical data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, the model analyzes patient data to assist in early diagnosis and treatment recommendations.


## **Technologies Used**
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Various machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow)

## **License**
This project is licensed under the **GPL-3.0 License.**
